    "contents" : "#Analyzing Red,Red Wine  \nby Michal Nadolny<br>\nInspired by https://youtu.be/zXt56MB-3vc (Great background music)<br>\nDataset Details: This tidy data set contains 1,599 red wines with 11 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). See more information on the data set in this <a href=\"wineQualityInfo.txt\" target=\"_blank\">file</a>. In this analysis we will be exploring which of the chemical properties influence the quality of red wines\n========================================================\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, packages}\n# Load all of the packages that you end up using\n# in your analysis in this code chunk.\n\n# Notice that the parameter \"echo\" was set to FALSE for this code chunk.\n# This prevents the code from displaying in the knitted HTML output.\n# You should set echo=FALSE for all code chunks in your file.\n#install.packages(plyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, Load_the_Data}\n# Load the Data\n#list.files() \nwineqr <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')\n```\n\n# Univariate Plots Section\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots}\nnames(wineqr)\nstr(wineqr)\nhead(wineqr)\nsummary(wineqr)\n```\nThese first couple lines of code allow us to explore the dataset. Shows X is the unique identifier in this dataset and we see the MAX is 1599 which is the count of rows.The median quality is at a 6 while the MIN and MAX are 3 and 8 respectively, but we'll get into more details on that in just a bit...\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots2}\nggplot(aes(x = quality), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"red\", \n    binwidth = .25)+scale_x_continuous(breaks = 2:8) +\nggtitle(\"Count of Quality Scores Binwidth .25\")\n```\n\nWe observe the judges mostly gave out 5 and 6 quality scores.\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots3}\nggplot(aes(x = residual.sugar), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"pink\")+scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:16) \n```\n\nMajority of red wines are not sweet. I'm curious what the scores were of really sweet ones...\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots4}\nggplot(aes(x=quality,y=residual.sugar), data = wineqr) + geom_point(color = \"green\")\n```\n\nSuprisingly, the outliers with high sugar recieved average 5 and 6 rating just like the rest of them.\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots5}\nggplot(aes(quality,alcohol),data=wineqr)+geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, size = 1)\n```\n\nNow we take a look at quality and alcohol, we can see there is linear growth.The dip on 5 is due to the amount of 5 quality rating given out. The numbers for quality =4,5,6 are shown below.\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots6}\nsummary(wineqr$quality==4)\nsummary(wineqr$quality==5)\nsummary(wineqr$quality==6)\n```\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots7}\nggplot(aes(quality, volatile.acidity),data=wineqr)+geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, size = 1)\n```\n\nAnother feature that will help support investigation is volatile acidity, from the dataset description the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste. Which I would think would lead to lower quality scores.\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, Univariate_Plots8}\nggplot(aes(quality, citric.acid),data=wineqr)+geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, size = 1)\nggplot(aes(quality, total.sulfur.dioxide),data=wineqr)+geom_point()+ stat_smooth(method = \"loess\", formula = y ~ x, size = 1)\n\nggplot(aes(x = density), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"white\")+scale_x_continuous() \n\nggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"blue\")+scale_x_continuous(breaks = 0:16) \n\n\n\n\nwineqr$gfree.sulfur.dioxide<-wineqr$free.sulfur.dioxide/1000\nwineqr$gtotal.sulfur.dioxide<-wineqr$total.sulfur.dioxide/1000\n```\n\n\n# Univariate Analysis\n\n### What is the structure of your dataset?\nThere are 1559 scores in the dataset with 11 input variables (based on physicochemical tests):<br>\n   1 - fixed acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)<br>\n   2 - volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)<br>\n   3 - citric acid (g / dm^3)<br>\n   4 - residual sugar (g / dm^3)<br>\n   5 - chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3<br>\n   6 - free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)<br>\n   7 - total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)<br>\n   8 - density (g / cm^3)<br>\n   9 - pH<br>\n   10 - sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)<br>\n   11 - alcohol (% by volume)<br>\n   Output variable (based on sensory data):<br> \n   12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)features (carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, and z).\n\n\n### What is/are the main feature(s) of interest in your dataset?\nThe main feature of interest is the quality score in the dataset.Each expert graded the wine quality  between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent), by exploring the MIN and MAX no experts gave any very bad or very excellent scores, techically the dataset shows on 3-8 quality scores.\n\n### What other features in the dataset do you think will help support your investigation into your feature(s) of interest?\nI think Alcohol will be important as it has a MIN is 8.40, while the MAX is 14.90. My early assumption is high alchol means higher quality, but we will have to explore further to prove that theory. \n\n### Did you create any new variables from existing variables in the dataset?\nYes I converted free.sulfur.dioxide and total.sulfur.dioxide to grams as the dataset was in milligrams. The new variables were name gfree.sulfur.dioxide and gtotal.sulfur.dioxide. I was hoping the conversion would give all the features a level playing field to compare to other features.\n\n### Of the features you investigated, were there any unusual distributions? Did you perform any operations on the data to tidy, adjust, or change the form of the data? If so, why did you do this?\nDensity and pH seemed to have the opposite distributions with the majority of the acid features. I always thought higher pH made water more, but I guess I was wrong. No changes were made to the data besides the two variables mentioned above.\n\n# Bivariate Plots Section\n```{r echo=FALSE, Bivariate_Plots}\n#Had to comment out because took too much time to plot\n#library(GGally)\n#theme_set(theme_minimal(10))\n#ggpairs(wineqr)\nnames(wineqr)\n```\n<img src=\"scatterplot matrix.png\">\n\n\n# Bivariate Analysis\n\n### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. How did the feature(s) of interest vary with other features in the dataset?\nFrom the scatterplot matrix we can observe these high correlations between these variables:<br>\nQuality and Alcohol: 0.476<br>\nQuality and Sulphates: 0.251<br>\nQuality and Citric Acid: 0.226<br>\n\n### Did you observe any interesting relationships between the other features (not the main feature(s) of interest)?\nI found pH and Density to be an interesting relationship seems they were affected with acid and sugar judging by thier scatterplots.\n\n### What was the strongest relationship you found?\nTechnically the strongest relationship was free.sulfur.dioxide and total.sulfur.dioxide but those features are just conversions from mg to g of eachother. In terms of strongest relationship to quality, as predicted, the strongest relationship was Quality and Alcohol with a correlation value of 0.476\n\n\n\n# Multivariate Plots Section\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, Multivariate_Plots}\n\n```\n\n# Multivariate Analysis\n\n### Talk about some of the relationships you observed in this part of the investigation. Were there features that strengthened each other in terms of looking at your feature(s) of interest?\nSome more relationships are noted above in the charts. A particular one that stands out is that PH and Density have the opposite slope when graphed with some of the other features. Ph and Density did not have a large impact on the quality score compared to the other features.\n\n### Were there any interesting or surprising interactions between features?\nFrom the description of the variables we can get a hint into some clear relationships in the chemistry as it may times one chemical bonds with another. For example the density of water is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content. We can see the density plot histogram looks like a bell curve. \n\n------\n\n# Final Plots and Summary\n\n### Plot One\n```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_One}\n#install.packages(\"ggthemes\")\n#library(ggthemes)\nggplot(aes(x = alcohol), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"red\")+scale_x_continuous(breaks = 7:16) + \n  facet_wrap(~quality)+ggtitle(\"Alcohol with Facet on Quality Score\")\n```\n\n### Description One\nHere we can see the distribution of Alcohol content to Quality Scores. we can see the scales slides to the right as the quality score increases.\n\n### Plot Two\n```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Two}\nggplot(wineqr, aes(quality, alcohol, colour = sulphates))+\n  geom_point(alpha=1/2)+ggtitle(\"Quality to Alchol Relationship with Sulphates\")\n```\n\n### Description Two\nThe scatterplot matrix revealed a positive correlation with sulphates so here we is how it is related to alcohol and quality. Sulphates is a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant. \n\n### Plot Three\n```{r echo=FALSE, Plot_Three}\nggplot(aes(x = citric.acid), data = wineqr) + geom_histogram(color = \"orange\")+scale_x_continuous(breaks = 7:16) + \n  facet_wrap(~quality)+ggtitle(\"Citric Acid with Facet on Quality Score\")\n```\n\n### Description Three\nFinally this shows how citric acid affects quality. Here we can see citric acid is distributed throughout the diffrent quality scores. Most are in the 5 and 6 score.\n------\n\n# Reflection\nWhich chemical properties influence the quality of red wines? As initially predicted alchol had the greatest influence on the quality rating of red wine followed by sulfates and citric acid.I found the scatterplot matrix provided the fastest and easiest way to get insight into the the relationships between features. While the summary command helped to understand the dataset features MIN,MAX,MEAN,etc. \n\nIn the dataset I struggled with some of the chemistry, there might have been more ways for me to explore and utilize this data if I had a better chemistry background. Another struggle was there was no non numeric data in the dataset. In another analysis it might be good to categories the wines into subsets to explore them further.\n\nAn idea for the future would be to combine the insights learned in this dataset with other datasets on wine. I noticed other organizations rate wine on a scale of 1-100 and don't get so complex with the chemistry in the features.Also noticed this data is missing the key detail of how long the wine has aged, wonder if this can someone be calculated through combining a few features. From my experience with wine, the older it is the better it tastes and that would be a key insight for this dataset if it was available.\n\n# References\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-themes-and-background-colors-the-3-elements\n\nhttp://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/faq/smooths.htm\n\n\n",
